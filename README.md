# INTERN TASKS

## TASK-0
Task-0 will make you understand how Buttons, EditTexts and TextViews interact with each other. So, what you have to do is build up an Android application containing the following widgets: -
 - An EditText
 - A Button
 - A TextView
Work of the widgets: -
 - EditText â€“ Takes a registration number as an input from the user.
 - Button: - Tapping this button would change its color to green and would display the output in the TextView.
 - TextView: - Would display the name of the person bearing the corresponding registration number.

So, basically you will have to build an app that takes in registration number as input, then upon tapping the button, makes it green and displays the name of the person.
